# Self-Improvement-Project


#### By **Elliot Burin**

## Description

This is an independent project where I will focus on and address my weaknesses, both technical and non-technical, from the last 14 weeks of school. 12-15-17



## Project

I feel that it is important to articulate and understand the rudimentary and technical concepts of coding along with the explaining the mechanics of what is happening on the computer screen or in the text editor through language.  This is one key imperfection I would greatly like to improve upon. In order to exercise this weakness I will sift through the lexicon of key words and concepts and type them out in order better my understanding retain the information.

BDD

1. Identify the simplest possible behavior our program must exhibit
2. Write a coded test
3. Before coding make sure the test fails
4. Implement the behavior with the least amount of code possible
5. Run the automated test to confirm it passes(if it does not revisit step 4).
6. Make sure all previous tests still pass.
7. Check if code can be refactored. If so refactor and repeat step 6.
8. Repeat this entire process with the next simplest behavior.

**Synchronous** - means the code runs right now.

**asynchronous** - means the code will run later.

**Ajax** - Stands for "asynchronous javascript XML. It is a technique to make web requests without a page reload.

**Same Origin Policy** - A security measure that only allows a web page to make AJAX requests to the same domain it was loaded from.

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** - a standard in which the server can specify which domains are allowed to make AJAX requests to it.  Some APIS allow all domains, others have stricter rules surrounding access.

**Client** - A tool (usually a web browser) that runs on the user's local machine and facilitates their interaction with the internet.

**Client-Side** - The actions that
must occur to run an application are handled primarily by the client instead of the server.

**Server-side** - Considered the "opposite" of client-side, in a sense applications in which the client's request to view a page triggers the execution of a script that runs on the server to generate dynamic HTML. This HTML is then sent to the client browser.

**Model-View-Controller** - A type of design followed by many frameworks (including Angular) in which an application and all interactions are managed by models, views, and controllers.

**Model** - Represents data and how the data is defined. Most applications require some sort of data.

**View** - The Portion of an application the user sees, or views. It represents the user interface of the application.

**Controller** - Handles input from the user such as clicks or browser events.  It is responsible for updating the model when necessary.

**Client-Side MVC** - An application that both follows the MVC design structure and relies on the client to handle most of the actions necessary to run.  Angular 2, for example.

**Component** - A small reusable package of both front and back-end code that works together.
That means components handle both rendering front-end pieces of user interface and any back-end logic required to make those front-end elements interactive.

**Polyfill** - Code that implements a feature on web browsers that don't technically support that feature. This code compensates for any issues older browsers may experience white running an application.

**SystemJS** - A module loader tool used internally by Angular to construct our applications.
